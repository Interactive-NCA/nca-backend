This repository contains a backend for hosting a neural cellular automata (NCA) model for generating Zelda levels. The model is built using PyTorch and is hosted using FastAPI and Google Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è. 

The NCA model uses a grid-based approach, where each cell in the grid represents a tile in the level. The model generates levels by updating each cell in the grid based on its neighboring cells, and then repeating this process for a set number of iterations. The output of the model is a 2D grid of tiles that represents a generated Zelda level.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:Interactive-NCA/nca-backend.git
```

Then, make a copy of the submodule:

```bash
cp -r app/ext/control-pcgnca app/ext/pcgnca
```

Next, you will need to install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before running the backend, make sure that in the [main.py](app/main.py) the variable `LOCAL` is set to `True`.
Finally, you can run the backend using the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI server, which you can access by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## üìù Usage

The backend provides a simple API for generating Zelda levels using the NCA model. To generate a level, you can send a POST request to the `/generate?path_length=${PATH_LENGTH}&symmetry=${SYMMETRY}` endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://nca-backend-rxv2teft2q-ew.a.run.app/generate?path_length=10&symmetry=10' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0],
       [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]'

```

The backend will respond with a JSON payload containing the generated level data:

```json
{
  "generated_map": [
    [0, 0, 0, ...],
    [0, 1, 1, ...],
    [0, 1, 1, ...],
    ...
  ]
}

```

The width and height parameters specify the dimensions of the generated level in tiles. The tiles parameter is a 2D array of integers, where each integer represents a tile in the level.

## üåê Deployment

This repository is configured for deployment using Google CloudÔ∏è ‚òÅÔ∏è. The application is re-deployed as a container on every push to the `main` branch.
